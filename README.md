# Pinyin Converter 
Pinyin Converter is a function that converts normal pinyin into a numeric pinyin format. This function came about from a need to convert thousands of pinyin words into something easier to type (it is much easier to type Nihao or Ni3hao3 than it is to type Nǐhǎo).  

You can download the files in the example folder and run example.py to see pinyin_converter in action. The program will convert hundreds of pinyin words into a numeric format and then export them to a new spreadsheet.      

## Usage  
Download pinyin_converter.py and keep it in the same folder as the program that you want to use it in.  
```
from pinyin_converter import pinyin_converter

pinyin_converter("Pīnyīn")
```
